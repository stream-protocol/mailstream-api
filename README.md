## Introduction

The **Mail**Stream SDK for Solana is a JavaScript library that allows developers to integrate Solana blockchain with the **Mail**Stream messaging service. This SDK provides a set of functions for making payments, sending messages, and interacting with Solana Name Service (SNS).

## Features:

- Initiate Solana transactions for payments.
- Compose and send messages via the **Mail**Stream API.
- Register, transfer ownership, and resolve names using Solana Name Service (SNS).

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use the **Mail**Stream SDK in your project, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install mailstream-sdk
```

### Usage

An example of how to use the SDK to send a payment and send a message:

```javascript
const mailstreamSDK = require('mailstream-sdk');

// Initialize the SDK with MailStream "Solana" wallet
const wallet = new mailstreamSDK.Wallet('YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY');

// Send a payment
const recipientAddress = 'RECIPIENT_SOLANA_ADDRESS';
const amountLamports = 1000000; 
const paymentSignature = wallet.sendPayment(recipientAddress, amountLamports);

// Send a message
const message = {
  to: 'recipient@mailstream.sol',
  subject: 'Hello',
  body: 'This is a test message.',
};
const messageResponse = wallet.sendMessage(message);

console.log('Payment Transaction:', paymentSignature);
console.log('Message Response:', messageResponse);
```

## Solana Name Service (SNS) Integration
